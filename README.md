## Ryan Suggestions/Notes

- 08/02/2023
  - In surrealestate there are several themed areas or "biomes" (its an unnatural world so biome doesn't quite work).
  - To access these areas you must 1st find the door with the lantern hanging over it.
  - The lantern will be turned off until you can find 5 moths scattered around my world and bring them to any lantern with 4 or less moths flying around it.
  - The moths act as keys and the lantern a lock.
  - Once 5 moths are flying around the lantern it will turn on and the door below will unlock.
  - Each new themed area -or "Parakosm" --as I'll call them-- will be locked behind a mothless lantern door.
