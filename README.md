## Ryan Suggestions/Notes

  - In surrealestate there are several themed areas or "biomes" (its an unnatural world so biome doesn't quite work).
  - To access these areas you must 1st find the door with the lantern hanging over it.
  - The lantern will be turned off until you can find 5 moths scattered around my world and bring them to any lantern with 4 or less moths flying around it.
  - The moths act as keys and the lantern a lock.
  - Once 5 moths are flying around the lantern it will turn on and the door below will unlock.
  - Each new themed area -or "Parakosm" --as I'll call them-- will be locked behind a mothless lantern door.

  - Have music transition options (like crossfade and others) on the transition or "door" window for moving from map to map.

  - Add a dungeon crawler like feature, where the player can explore a 90's like dungeon crawler envrionment (2D-3D design).

  - A tile that will override any collisions. It will be invisible when the game runs, but in the editor will be a translucent X in the outline of a tile, and another one with an O. The O block will be 
    passable, the X unpassable, and a third will be a block you can go behind like a tree top. So all together 3 collision/passability override blocks.
